## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is one of my first attempts using Flexbox and I am still getting used to it. In this project I had to add a media query to change the default properties of the flexbox so that the cards would stack vertically on smaller devices.
I built the page on a large screen first and then added media queries for smaller devices to make it mobile friendly.
